/**
 * An abstract superclass for all logical mathematical constructions that can be
 * a part of a TeXFormula. All subclasses must implement the abstract
 * {@link #createBox(TeXEnvironment)} method that transforms this logical unit into
 * a concrete box (that can be painted). They also must define their type, used for
 * determining what glue to use between adjacent atoms in a "row construction". That can
 * be one single type by asigning one of the type constants to the {@link #type} field.
 * But they can also be defined as having two types: a "left type" and a "right type".
 * This can be done by implementing the methods {@link #getLeftType()} and
 * {@link #getRightType()}.
 * The left type will then be used for determining the glue between this atom and the
 * previous one (in a row, if any) and the right type for the glue between this atom and
 * the following one (in a row, if any).
